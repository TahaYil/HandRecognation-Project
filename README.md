# HandRecognation-Project
It is a project that detects what is written in handwriting and who wrote it.

# explanation
I use 2 different models to predict in the project. The first model detects lines from the entire page then crops them and sends them to the OCR model. The second model predicts who this text belongs to.

# Models
For the first model, I trained it using the YOLO v11 algorithm.
For model 2 training I used the ViT Classification algorithm
